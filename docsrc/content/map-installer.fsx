# Map Installer #

The map installer is a way for players to easily keep track of and stay up-to-date on the latest
community created content. It splits the available actions into three simple categories:

## Available ##
  
Content that has not yet been installed, or has a newer version available (if you've opted out of the auto
update feature). You can simply click the plus symbol next to each map to start the installation, or 
click the install all maps button to queue everything up for download and installation.

    <div class="well well-small" id="nuget">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Installed ##

This lists all currently installed maps with some of the more pertinent meta-data, such as author, release date, 
recommended players, version number, name, map size (file sizes), and a picture if provided.

You can uninstall maps here by clicking the action buttons on the side of each map and clicking uninstall, or 
if you want to remove all maps there is an uninstall all button.

## Installing ##

This section will display currently installing maps, along with a progress bar. You can also cancel map 
installations by clicking the action bar for the map, or cancel all installations by clicking the cancel all 
button at the bottom of the screen.
