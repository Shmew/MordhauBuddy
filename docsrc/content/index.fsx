# What is MordhauBuddy? #

MordhauBuddy is a collection of tools that the community already has in piecemeal or not at all, and tries to 
not only bring them all into a convenient package, but to also allow for cross platform functionality, and reduce 
the burden of keeping track and updating each separate piece of software. MordhauBuddy will automatically update 
when a new version is released.

The main features that MordhauBuddy enables you to do is:
 - Keep up to date on community events
   - This is still on-going, stay tuned!
 - Install the latest community maps
   - Auto updates based on your preferences
 - Manage custom settings not available in the UI
   - Things like Runescape mode, and disabling in-game fog.
 - Modify character faces with multiple options:
   - Frankenstein - Set all values to the minimum or maximum allowed
   - Random - Set all values randomly
   - Import - Import someone else's character so you can be ugly together
   - Export - Spread your filth with the world
 - Creates and manages backups for any non-map related task
   - Can be adjusted in the settings
