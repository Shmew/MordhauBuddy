# Mordhau Config #

The mordhau config tab has a list of commonly set confguration items 
that cannot be managed directly through the game UI. Many people either have 
to go and edit the file everytime they want to change a value, or type it into 
the console each time the game is launched. MordhauBuddy will set these values for you 
in your Engine.ini and GameUserSettings.ini as well as back the data up. 

This makes making changes to settings significantly less cumbersome, as well as let you discover 
other options you may not be aware of, such as disabling sun glare, or in-game fog. 
Values that have a more subjective setting will have sliders available so you can adjust them 
to your liking.
