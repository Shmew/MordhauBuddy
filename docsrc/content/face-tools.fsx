# Face Tools #

The face tools functionality lets you customize your character faces 
in ways that would be cumbersome normally.

The first page will load all the available profiles you have created, 
you may then select which profiles you would like to modify/export and then 
go to the next page.


<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">
    <img src="img/faceToolsProfiles.png"/>
  </div>
</div>

On the second page this is where the magic happens. You can choose to 
give your character the maximum and minimum values for each aspect of their face 
via the Frankenstein option, or simply randomize and see what you come up with. 
This page also have the functionality to import and export profiles so you can easily 
share your creations with others.
